# Breast-cancer-prediction
Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, emphasizing
the need for effective and accurate diagnostic tools. This project presents a
comprehensive approach to breast cancer detection utilizing machine learning
techniques. The primary objective is to develop a robust and reliable model
capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors based on a
diverse set of features.Features were computationally extracted from digital
images of fine needle aspirate biopsy slides.The significance of this project
lies in its potential to enhance early detection of breast cancer, leading to
improved patient outcomes.The outcomes of the model, validated against
standard medical diagnoses, demonstrate promising results in terms of accuracy and reliability.
This project contributes to the ongoing efforts in the
field of medical diagnostics by providing an effective and interpretable tool
for breast cancer detection.
